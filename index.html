                There are several advantages to running panels in the presence of a
                whole exome, including flexible test design, flexible re-testing, and
                increased functionality.

                                comprehensive panel that can be expanded over time. With
                                ~20,000 genes sequenced in each sample, every gene becomes a
                                candidate for inclusion. And, while we have ensured the
                                highest call rates across those genes that are most likely to
                                belong to a panel, the Exome+ assay delivers high call rates
